autoscript.py is my automatic submission script for Janus
hw-plots.py plots my graphs

all other programs are compiled with:

	$mpicc program.c -lm -o program.o

and run with

	$mpiexec -np NP ./program.out -type 

where NP is the number of cores and type is '-h' high to low or '-l' low to high
The simple allreduce and fanin-fanout don't take a type.
