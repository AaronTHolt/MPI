compile with:

	./compile.sh

run with:

	mpiexec -np [NP] [prog].c [MATRIX_SIZE]

FOR PROGRAM 4.1 (serial):
still run with mpiexec (i used wtime to time still), use NP=1

FOR PROGRAM 4.3 (fox):
Matrix size should be square.
Assume that the number of processors is a square number, and that sqrt(processors) evenly divides MATRIX_SIZE.
