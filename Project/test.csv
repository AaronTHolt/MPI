111447,"Giant cell convection in this body has provided evidence for fast dynamo flow which suggests that this body may have a magnetic field.	Its motion shows it to be a member of the OB1 association of its constellation.	It was the first star to have its diameter measured accurately by Michelsons interferometer method, and its name is a corruption of the Arabic term for The Hand of the Central One.	Along with Procyon and Sirius, it is the northwestern star of the winter triangle.	Its distance was recently revised to 640 light years which makes it the closest red giant to our solar system, and along with Antares, it is one of two supergiants with a magnitude less than one.	Misclassified as the alpha star of a certain constellation, for 10 points, name this variable star that, along with Rigel, dominates the constellation Orion."
123786,"This body's differential rotation combines with magneto-hydro-dynamic effects to form a magnetic field known as the Parker spiral.	Thermal columns in the convection zone cause the granulation of this body.	The discovery of flavor oscillation resolved this body's namesake ""neutrino problem.	"" ""Bow shock"" is the phenomenon in which the flow of plasma from this body is interrupted by a planetary magnetic field.	It creates its namesake ""wind"" as its corona expands into space.	For 10 points, name this star that is one astronomical unit away from Earth."
120249,"Masubi and Amirani are two notable features of this object; those are dust varieties, in contrast with Tvashtar, which some times termed a stealth one.	Laplace created a theory to explain its orbital resonance with two other similar objects, and Pioneer 11 discovered a strong belt of radiation from a larger nearby object that completely envelopes this one.	This object's orbit is extremely elliptical in nature, due to its orbital resonance with two other moons of its planet, which creates extreme fluctuations in the crust of this moon, therefore generating an extreme amount of internal heat, which manifests itself in violent ejections of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.	For 10 points, what is this moon, the most geologically active object in the Solar System, and the innermost Galilean moon of Jupiter"
102735,"A theorized inner region to this area is named after Hills.	Safranov and Cameron proposed the two most widely accepted models of its origin, and the object Gliese 710 may cause havoc here sometime within the next ten million years.	2000 CR105 is one of only two objects identified that may belong to this group.	Richard A. Muller suggested that a brown dwarf that orbits the sun periodically disrupts this area, and it extends nearly a quarter of the way to Proxima Centauri.	For 10 points, name this region of space thought to contain 90377 Sedna, theorized to be the source of long-range comets and named after a Dutch dude."
108684,"The most distant of these objects exhibit Gunn-Peterson troughs in their spectra, indicating they were formed before the re-ionization of the universe completed.	Only 10 percent are radio loud, they are similar to BL Lac and Seyfert objects.	3C 273, one of the first of these discovered, is also one of the few that can be viewed through an amateur-quality telescope.	They are believed to be powered by super-massive black holes at their centers, with in-falling matter as the source of their intense luminosity.	Considered a type of active galaxy, for ten points, name these extremely energetic celestial objects"
117225,"Magnetohydrodynamic effects on the sun's magnetic field create this type of structure named for Parker.	Horizontal wind sets the surface layer into motion, causing one of these structures to form in the ocean, in a form of them named for Ekman.	A diagram of the parametric point of the Fresnel functions takes the form of this structure; that diagram is named for Cornu.	The Tully-Fisher relation is the relationship between the stellar mass and intrinsic luminosity of galaxies that take this shape.	For 10 points, name these structures, exemplified by galaxies like Andromeda that aren't elliptical but can be barred."
102177,"One of these in Lepus became the prototype for the T spectral class.	They can be distinguished from low-mass stars because of their lithium content and from high-mass (*) planets by their density and x- ray spectra.	Lying in spectral classes M, L, and T, for 10 points identify these astronomical objects which are failed stars that lack the mass to initiate thermonuclear fusion."
102096,"One source of these phenomena is stellar collapse such as that which occurs in type II supernovae, and in 1974 Hulse and Taylor inferred the existence of these phenomena by studying the energy (*) loss from a rotating pulsar.	Most famously sought by the LIGO experiment, for 10 points identify these phenomena which represent traveling wave solutions to the Einstein field equations."
111843,"There is an upper limit on the amount of these that can be produced during D-brane inflation, due to a bound on maximal field variation.	LISA will eventually work on detecting these Ground-based sensors for detecting these must be isolated from all seismic disturbances, the most sensitive of which are currently located in Louisiana and Washington, called LIGO.	Einstein predicted their existence as part of his General Theory of Relativity, and the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was given to two Princeton astrophysicists for their discovery of a pulsar that exhibits these.	For 10 points, identify these energy ripples throughout the universe, most commonly produced by binary star systems."
102636,"Pneuman and Kopp provided the first ab initio model of this phenomenon by integrating the MHD equation for a dipole source; their model closely matched Parkers 1956 model.	Evidence for this object was provided by Biermanns observations of comets, though it was not observed until Luna 1.	Its interaction with the terrestrial magnetic field results in the bow shock.	It ceases being supersonic at the termination shock and its velocity falls to zero at the heliopause, where it merges with the interstellar medium.	Radiation pressure and pressure from this plasma flow cause comet tails to always face away from the center of the solar system.	For 10 points, name this stream of particles constantly emanating from the sun."
117486,"This object had a hydrogen atmosphere blown away by solar wind and was thought to develop ridges on its terrain when its neighboring satellite pulled it into an elliptical orbit, squeezing this moon and rumpling its crust.	The Hubble Telescope detected an ozone here in 1995, and the Galileo spacecraft has detected a (*) magnetic field around this moon, which is stronger than those found on other satellites.	One prominent feature of this moon is the dark plain named Galileo Regio.	It is the largest of a group consisting of Callisto, Io, and others that orbit the same planet.	For 10 points, identify this moon of Jupiter, the largest satellite in the solar system."
113022,"evolutionary-motive behavior of this region is typically modeled by hybrid symplectic/Bulirsch-Stoer integrators.	Discovered using a blink comparator enhanced by several charge coupled devices, its brightness follows a negative 4 power law, and Yelle and Stansberry confirmed the variable emissivity associated with objects within it is controlled by surface ratios of alpha to beta nitrogen.	(*) Secular resonances are responsible for its various gaps, including a noticeable ""cliff"" located at the 1:2 orbital resonance zone.	The Nice model proposes that at least some of its mass was removed by gas giants, its present location being an indicator of early outmigration of the larger planets.	Mostly populated by objects known as cubewanos, For 10 points, name this astronomical region containing bodies such as Sedna, Quaor, Pluto, and a billion or so short-period comets."
118008,"Appearing suddenly in the 1860s, it was first noted by R. P. Greg in December of 1862.	Though it began unimpressively, the number of objects per hour has increased nearly tenfold through the decades.	Its origin remained a question until 1983 when NASA's Infrared Astronomical Satellite discovered the (*) asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which had a perfect orbital match to it.	Known for its multi-colored display, it is best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere beginning around December 6.	For 10 points, name this annual meteor shower whose radiant is in the constellation containing the stars Castor and Pollux."
109440,"These objects obey the D n sigma relation derived by Dressler from a relation between three of their observables known as the fundamental plane.	Their surface brightness profiles are well-fit by the de Vaucouleurs R to the one-fourth law, and their luminosities correlate with their central velocity dispersions, a result known as the Faber-Jackson relation.	Examples of these early-type members of the Hubble sequence include the giant M87, which includes many globular clusters in its population of old stars.	Subclassified by the ratio of their minor and major axes, FTP name this morphological class of galaxies which vary from spheroidal to nearly cigar-shaped."
7956,"In 1936 this scientist went to the University of Chicago, becoming a professor of astronomy and director of the university's Yerkes and McDonald observatories.	His achievements include measurement of the diameter of Pluto, the discovery of some satellites of Uranus and Neptune, and the detection of carbon dioxide on Mars.	In the 1960's, he served as chief scientist for the Ranger spacecraft crash-landing probes of the moon.	FTP, name this American astronomer who, in 1951, predicted the existence of a disk-shaped region outside the orbit of Neptune as a source for short-period comets."
7965,"Following education and research in Massachusetts and Berlin, from 1888-91 he organized the Kenwood Observatory in Chicago.	From there, he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago and began organizing the Yerkes Observatory, located in Williams Bay, Wisconsin.	FTP, name this astronomer, known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots and for development of astronomical instruments such as the spectroheliograph and the 200 inch reflecting telescope at Mount Palomar."
7974,"In 1993 it imaged the asteroid 243 Ida and discovered its moon.	The only observer able to view directly the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy, it also bolstered evidence of an ocean on Europa and released a probe that descended into the Jovian atmosphere.	For ten points, what space mission was named after the scientist who first observed Jupiter with a telescope"
7983,"Skylab 4 made detailed observations of it, but from Earth it was a faint smudge near Venus and Jupiter, apparently because it was enveloped in a Hydrogen cloud.	This disappointed people who were told that it would be 5 times brighter than the moon and that its tail would stretch across 1/6 of the sky.	FTP what comet, named for its Czech discoverer, snuck past us in late 1973 and early 1974."
7992,"Ernest Opik suggested its existence in 1932, but it was the man who also showed that the stars nearer to the center of  the Milky Way rotate faster than the outer ones that made a coherent case for it in 1950.	Distant enough to be gravitationally influenced by other stars, it is composed of icy planetesimals spherically distributed around the Sun at a distance of 1 light year.	For ten points, what cometary source forms a cloud around the solar system many times bigger than the Kuiper Belt"
8001,"This moon is covered with large impact craters, with the largest, Stickney, measuring 11.5 kilometers in diameter, and it also features several families of parallel grooves or chains of craters.	It is irregularly shaped, measuring 27 by 22 by 19 kilometers in size, and maintains a distance of only 6,000 kilometers from the surface, making it the innermost of its planet's moons.	Like its famous partner, it always keeps one face turned towards the planet's surface, and was discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877.	FTP, what is this larger moon of Mars, the partner of Deimos"
8010,"The father of this man was also an astronomer who formulated the law named for him which states that only absorbed radiation can produce chemical change and who had taken the first photograph of the moon in 1840.	He himself taught medicine and physics at the City University of New York and was the first to photograph the spectra of a star, Vega, and the first to photograph a nebula, the Orion, but his name is now most commonly attached to a project begun on his behalf after his death.	FTP name this astronomer whose wife set up a memorial fund at Harvard which resulted in the catalogue of stellar spectra named for him."
8019,"They are fixed points of the circular restricted three-body problem.	The first three are unstable to radial perturbations but the final two are in islands of stability.	The SoHO spacecraft orbits one in the Earth-Sun system, and for ten points, two in the Earth-Moon system are likely sites for space colonies built at what points named for a French mathematician."
8028,"In 1912, this scientist led an expedition to Brazil to study an eclipse.	Six years later, he confirmed Einstein's prediction that light is bent when passing near the Sun.	His works include Stellar Movements and the Structure of the Universe, and the 1926 Internal Construction of the Stars.	Identify this British astrophysicist who showed that the luminosity of a star depends almost exclusively on its mass, and who, FTP, discovered the role of radiation pressure in the maintenance of stellar equilibrium."
8037,"Delta Scuti is sometimes called a ""dwarf"" type of them.	Photon pressure causes them to rapidly expand in size; however, when the star has expanded, the pressure gradient is then too weak to counteract gravity, leading to contraction.	Their classical or Type I variety is the generally thought to be the most useful after Henrietta Leavitt discovered their period-luminosity relationship.	FTP, name these stars used as a standard candle in making astronomical distance measurements, one of the major classes of variable stars."
8046,"The red dwarf Wolf 359, the third closest neighbor of the sun, lies in this constellation, which also includes the ninth magnitude galaxies M65 and M66.	Its sickle includes Rasalas, Adhafera, and its gamma star Algieba, which consists of two orange giants, and its alpha star, the twenty-fifth brightest star in the sky, while Denebola, its beta star, is located at the tip of its tail.	Situated to the south of Ursa Major, FTP, name this constellation, whose brightest star is Regulus."
8055,"Magnetic field analysis shows that this moon may contain a salty ocean 200 kilometers underground.	Its major sites include the crater chain Gipul Catena, and the Valhalla Region, one of the largest impact features in the solar system.	Though it has both the oldest and most heavily cratered landscape in the solar system, it has no large mountains and next to no tectonic or volcanic activity.	Like its three companions, it was discovered by Simon Marius in 1610.	FTP, identify this second-largest and outermost Galilean moon of Jupiter."
8064,"De Lalande designated part of this constellation as the Quadrans Muralis, so the meteor shower originating in it is known as the Quantradid.	Its tau star supports a planetary system, while its mu star, Alkarulops, is a binary system with a period of approximately 260 years.	In 1829, Wilhelm von Struve discovered that its epsilon star, Izar, was an orange giant with an accompanying green-blue star usually known as Pulcherrima.	Followed in the night sky by the Canes Venatici and chasing Ursa Major, FTP, name this constellation, the ""Bear Guard,"" whose brightest star is Arcturus."
8073,"This has provided the best current measurement for the Hubble constant, which may be inferred from WMAP's measurements of it anisotropy.	Other anisotropies in this field can be caused by gravitational waves or the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.	It was generated at a redshift of approximately 1100, implying that the temperature of the universe at the last scattering surface was about 3000 Kelvin.	Accidentally discovered in 1964 by Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias, FTP, what is this ubiquitous radiation field corresponding to a blackbody of 2.7 Kelvins"
8082,"His time in Japan led to the writing of Noto, while his time as foreign secretary to the mission to Korea led to the writing of Choson, The Land of the Morning Calm.	Those books had little in common with this man's later writings, such as The Evolution of Worlds and The Genesis of the Planets.	In his major scientific project, this man competed with the discoverer of Saturn's moon Phoebe, William Pickering.	This man's work built on observations made by Richard Proctor, and agreed with the assumptions of Nicolas Flammarion and the director of the Brera Observatory in Milan.	Harold Spencer Jones later offered an explanation of this man's observations by showing that smudges at the edge of vision appear to be connected straight lines.	He correctly guessed the existence of a ""Planet X"" beyond Neptune, but was less successful in his observations of a planet closer to Earth.	FTP, name this American astronomer who claimed to have seen ""canals"" on Mars."
8091,"A localized region on this body has been termed ""hilly and lineated,"" or ""weird terrain.	""  That region of this body's Discovery Quadrangle is hypothesized to have formed due to seismic waves generated by the formation of the antipodal feature.	Smooth plains, including Odin and Tir Planitiae, surround its large, multiring Caloris impact basin.	The 43 arc-second per century forward shift in its perihelion was an early observed confirmation of general relativity.	FTP, name this terrestrial planet visited by Mariner 10, the innermost of the solar system."
8100,"The first extrasolar planet to be definitively confirmed was found orbiting one of these objects by Alexander Wolszczan.	One subclass of them is also known as the ""recycled"" type, and the Hulse-Taylor binary one provided the first observational evidence of gravity waves.	Roche lobe overflow leads to the accretion-powered ones that emit x-rays, while the decay of a strong magnetic field powers the magnetar class.	Glitches can occur in the originally discovered type of these objects, whose misalignment of rotation and magnetic axes is responsible for their most prominent feature.	For 10 points, name these rotating neutron stars that regularly emit radiation."
8109,"Evidence for recent volcanic activity on this planet is found near both Paragon Chasma and in the Sif Mons region.	It possesses two ""continents,"" large regions several kilometers above the average elevation, that are named for a Babylonian deity and its Roman equivalent.	It takes 243 days to turn about its axis, making its day longer than its year, and its rotation is retrograde.	Sulfuric acid droplets, rather than water, form clouds that obscure features like  Maxwell Montes and insure a runaway ""greenhouse"" effect.	The second brightest object in the night sky is, FTP, what ""sister planet"" of earth and second planet from the Sun"
8118,"An extraordinarily active filamentary source of these items was discovered by Giovanni Schiaparelli, who called their origin 1862 III.	Recorded for millennia, these objects were sometimes called St. Lawrence's tears.	Becoming prominent when the earth intersects the orbit of Swift-Tuttle, these objects are easily visible throughout the Northern Hemisphere and climaxed on July 11th this year.	FTP, name this meteor shower named for the constellation in which they appear, a depiction of an ancient Greek hero."
8127,"During the late stages of their evolution, they provide the primary environment for the s-process.	They show absorption features from titanium oxide and technetium, implying convective mixing in a dredge-up phase associated with their thermal pulses.	They are initially supported by hydrogen shell burning before evolving onto the horizontal branch following the helium flash.	The final thermal pulse of one of these objects can blow off a planetary nebula and leave a remnant white dwarf, a fate that is thought to await the Sun.	FTP, name this post-main-sequence phase of evolution which sees low and medium-mass stars puff up to large sizes and cool off, producing the namesake color."
8136,"A type of these objects located at the ""tip"" of their namesake ""branch"" are used as standard candles.	The occurrence of a degenerate core causes them to increase temperature very rapidly while maintaining their volumes, which results in the ""helium flash,"" after which convert three helium nuclei to a carbon-12 nucleus via a Beryllium intermediate in the triple alpha process.	Eventually, their outer regions expand to form a planetary nebula, after which they become white dwarves.	For 10 points, identify these stars exemplified by Arcturus, whose cool temperatures are the cause of their namesake color."
8145,"Dodelson and Liguori showed in a 2006 paper that the vector field introduced in Bekenstein's relativistic version of this theory could play a role in generating the instability that produces large-scale cosmic structures.	Mathematically, it results from a modification of Poisson's equation, and evidence against this theory came in 2006 when the Bullet Cluster was observed to exhibit gravitational lensing that evidently doesn't result from baryonic matter.	It proposes that a function of unknown form denoted ""mu of a over a-zero,"" which approaches unity if the ratio is much greater than one, alters the law of physics traditionally used to calculate force.	Proposed by Mordehai Milgrom to solve the problem of galactic rotation, for 10 points, identify this theory that is an alternative to Dark Matter. "
8154,"Research by Papathinasiou and Wasserburg in the 1970s demonstrated that the SNC meteorites originated from this body.	The earliest stage of evolution of this body is called the Noachian epoch, and a large formation on this body has deformed its lithospheric crust to create features like the Argyre basin.	Unlike its nearest neighbor of the same type, this body lacks a dipolar magnetic field, thought the presence of radial magnetic fields suggest that it may be home to a magma ocean.	Its surface is home to the Hellas impact basin as well as a long trench running 3000 miles from the Noctis Labyrinthus, and the Phoenix mission has recently confirmed the discovery of water on this body.	Home to the Tharsis region, the Valles Marineris, and the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, for 10 points, identify this planet orbited by Deimos and Phobos, which is red."
101358,"Robert Duncan and Christopher Thompson first formulated the definitive theory of these objects, which they proposed as an explanation for soft gamma repeaters.	Much of the evidence for the existence of these objects was collected by Chryssa Kouveliotou from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, and their surfaces are thought to be covered in fibers of compressed atoms, while Alfven heating is thought to drive their wind-aided spindown model of energy loss.	Vacuum birefringence is hypothesized to occur in the vicinity of these objects, and like the larger class of objects to which they belong, their mass is subject to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.	Forming when a helically stable dynamo arises during gravitational collapse, for ten points, identify these neutron stars with incredibly strong magnetic fields."
8199,"In 1921, its functional significance was determined.	Otto Loewi took fluid from a frog's heart, whose contractions had been slowed, and let it perfuse a second, unstimulated heart, slowing its beating as well.	Mimicked by nicotine, this neurotransmitter plays a major role in memory as well as muscle control.	FTP, name this primary neurotransmitter between neurons and muscles."
8208,"It never undergoes recombination and the expression of genes linked with it gives rise to Sertoli, not follicle, cells.	It contains only 35 million base pairs, making it the smallest human chromosome, and its presence explains the prevalence of muscular dystrophy and hemophilia in certain population segments.	FTP, name this sex chromosome."
8217,"The similarities between the eyes of this class and those of humans is an example of convergent evolution.	Among the most intelligent invertebrates, they have tentacles around their mouths and often have reduced or absent shells.	They, like gastropods and bivalves, are molluscs.	For ten points, name this class which includes the extinct ammonites, the chambered Nautilus, squid, and octopi."
8226,"This substance's patent was acknowledged as among the ten which shaped the world.	Isolated while studying the biochemistry of actinomycetes, it is closely related to the substances clavacin, neomycin, and grisein.	A Nobel Prize was awarded to Selman Waksman for, for ten points, the discovery of what antibiotic, the first effective treatment for tuberculosis."
8235,"Its parts include the square and flat body, and two each of the greater cornua and lesser cornua.	The lesser cornu is small and conical, and from the medial side of its base arises the Chondroglossus.	The cranial surface of the greater cornu is the origin of the Constrictor pharyngis medius.	Suspended from the tips of the styloid processes of the temporal bones by ligaments, FTP, name this bone named for its ""U"" shape, which serves as the anchoring structure for the tongue."
8244,"With scientific name Sarcophilus harrisii, it is about the size of a small badger with brown or black fur except for the white throat region.	Widely distributed throughout the continent until being displaced by the dingo, it stays in burrows during the day and emerges at night to prey on rodents, lizards, wallabies, and other small animals.	FTP, name this largest carnivorous marsupial, now confined to the island for which it is named and to various Warner Brothers cartoons."
8253,"During this stage, the spindle asters define the position of the contractile ring and thus the plane of cytokinesis.	The nucleoli and nuclear membranes reform and the two groups of chromosomes uncoil to reform chromatin as the spindle which separated them during anaphase breaks down in, for ten points, what stage of mitosis"
8262,"A good example of an alpha-helix protein is this fibrous, structural protein arranged in parallel sheets held together by hydrogen bonding.	Cysteine accounts for as much as 24% of the weight but its weight still remains overwhelmingly dependent on water and hydration.	For ten points, name this protein that makes up the majority of finger nails, and hair."
8271,"The Ascomycetes member provides shade and forms structures, including haustoria and appressoria, which penetrate the photosynthetic cells.	Often the first colonists of rocky areas, these organisms, which include reindeer moss, live in some of the world's harshest habitats, including within 4 degrees of the south pole.	For ten points, name these mutualistic associations between fungi and algae."
8280,"Caused by an enterovirus with three serotypes, it's typically transmitted through contact with infected saliva or feces.	Most infections are asymptomatic, but in some the virus inflames the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, causing muscle pain and paralysis.	For ten points, name this disease, occurring mainly in children, among whose famous victims was Franklin Delano Roosevelt."
8289,"This scientist discovered parthenogenesis in aphids, as well as protozoa, which he called animalicules.	Apprenticed to a cloth maker in his native Delft, where he was friends with Jan Vermeer, in 1660 he obtained the sinecure of chamberlain to the sheriffs of Delft, after which he undertook work which led him to see bacteria, sperm, and red blood cells, achievements not repeated for more than a century.	FTP, who was this Dutch pioneer in microscopic research"
8298,"In samples, the presence of gram negative cocci pairs displaying a typical kidney bean shape is usually a diagnostic of this disease.	Occasionally, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or even death if the infection spreads to the lungs, heart, or brain.	A member of the genus Neisseria, it is usually treated with Cetriaxone, Cefixime, Ciprofloaxin, or Ofloxacin, but not Penicillin, as it has developed resistance to that drug.	Characterized by appearance of pus and a burning feeling during urination, this is, FTP, what venereal disease also known as ""the clap"""
8307,"Following the expression of the RAG-1 gene, the V and J genes are randomly joined just before the formation of one of the four major portions of these substances.	Susumo Tonegawa first explained their variability in the 1970s by using recombinant DNA cloning and pointing out differences in their kappa and gamma chains.	All of them consist of two domains known as constant and variable regions, which are present on both their heavy and light chains.	Divided into five classes of ""I-sub-G's"" or immunoglobulins, FTP, name these proteins produced by B cells in response to the presence of an antigen."
8316,"In birds this body contains magnetic material needed for navigation.	Also called the epiphysis cerebri, it is largest in children, shrinking during puberty and calcifying with increasing age.	In all humans it appears to play a major role in sexual development and sleep patterns.	It may indirectly be the cause of Seasonal Affective Disorcer because it is photosensitive and increases the release of melatonin during the winter.	FTP, identify this gland also known as the ""third eye"" and named for its pine-cone shape."
8325,"Their advanced eyes had structures similar to the Descartes and Huygens designs for minimal-aberration lenses.	The early Redlichiida order had a simple glabella and small pygidium.	Agnostida was smaller than a centimeter, and the other six orders of this class were the Corynexochida, Asaphida, Ptychopariida, Proetida, Lichida and Phacopida.	Because their hard exoskeletons are easily preserved and dated, their fossils are often used as chronological markers.	FTP, name this class of extinct ""three-lobed"" arthropods."
8334,"A type of marasmus, this condition can be effectively treated by the consumption of dried skim milk.	It is common to children weaned on a diet consisting chiefly of cereal grains and starchy foods; and its most common symptoms include potbelly, anemia and edema, and depigmentation of the skin.	Another symptom is the reddish-orange coloration of hair, which led in part to this affliction's connotation of ""red boy"" in one dialect.	FTP, identify this disease of severe protein malnutrition that takes its name, meaning ""deposed child,"" from the Niger-Congo dialect of Ghana where it is most predominant."
8343,"W. D. Hamilton of the London School of Economics first developed this theory, building on the earlier work of Wynne-Edwards.	Hamilton noticed that male Hymenopterans develop from unfertilized eggs and only have one copy of each chromosome, which means that sisters share more genes with each other then they would share with their own daughters.	It is also seen in burrow-dwelling squirrels, where certain altruistic females give alarm calls in response to predators.	FTP, identify this theory in which individuals behave altruistically so that their relatives have a better chance of survival."
8352,"Similar to hemoglobins, in these compounds a carbon-hydrogen phytol chain is attached to a porphyrin ring surrounding a central magnesium atom.	The rare type e is found in golden algae while types a and b are the major forms in higher plants where it is found in chloroplasts.	For ten points, name this class of pigments vitally important to photosynthesis."
8361,"Like several other organs, this organ is restrained by the peritoneum.	Attached to the peritoneum below the capsule are the two ligaments that hold its protective serous and fibroelastic coats in place and allow this organ to expand and contract after digestion.	Below the hilum, one of its coats reflects inward into branching sheets that radiate the trabeculae that separate its pulp-containing areolae, where the reticulum connects this organ to the lienal artery and allows it to fulfill its primary function.	Made up of red and white pulp, in times of bone marrow breakdown it produces red blood cells.	FTP, name this primary filtering organ for the blood."
8370,"The most common form of this disease is caused in part by choline deficiency, while the biliary type is caused by disruption of bile flow and is more common in women.	Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most lethal complications of this disease, whose portal type is the most common, and is frequently found in middle-aged males with a history of chronic alcoholism.	FTP, what is this degeneration of the tissue of the liver"
8379,"Pott's disease softens this anatomical part and features migrating abscesses that move up and down the structure.	It begins below the foramen magnum and features a primary curve modified by three more, while its consistent parts each feature a centrum with a y-shaped arch.	Its sections at the top named atlas and axis form the cervical region, while the caudal region ends with the coccyx.	FTP identify this structure which evolved from the primitive notochord and protects the Central Nervous System."
8388,"Diseases caused by defects in these include hyperoxaluria, Refsum's disease, and Zellweger syndrome.	Although involved in bile acid synthesis, amino acid metabolism and cholesterol synthesis, the most important function of these organelles may be the beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids.	FTP, name this type of organelle which contains enzymes such as catalase and is named due to its role in the production and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide."
8397,"Scientists have recently discovered that those with multiple sclerosis carry antibodies against this infectious agent, and that its T cell receptors appear to be remarkably conserved.	Generally designated HHV-4, it infects B lymphocytes where it remains latent after infection.	A member of the herpesviruses, it causes such conditions as oral hairy leukoplakia and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.	Perhaps more famous for causing such diseases as Hodgkin's disease and Burkitt's lymphoma, FTP, identify this virus type named after its two English discoverers, best known for causing mononucleosis."
8406,"Photosynthetic bacteria build a version of this enzyme that contains only two chains, yet functions as well as the plant version that contains 8 large chains and 8 small chains.	Three amino acids, including a modified form of lysine, surround its active site, which is arranged around a magnesium ion.	With an activity of only 3 molecules per second, its inefficiency is compounded by its inability to distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide.	Its function is to create organic carbon from carbon dioxide.	FTP, name this key enzyme in the Calvin Cycle that is also the most abundant protein on earth."
8415,"Infertility is one of the two most common complaints leading to its diagnosis.	In addition to taurodontism, it causes linguistic impairment and fatigue-induced learning disabilities but does not cause mental disability.	Increased maternal age may be a risk factor for this syndrome, which affects one in seven hundred males and causes infertility, increased height, gynecomastia, low levels of body hair, and small genitalia due to inadequate testosterone production.	FTP, name this genetic syndrome, caused by an extra X chromosome."
8424,"In the middle layers of this structure, amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cells work together to produce a graded response to synaptic input from receptors, which they transfer to the outermost layer of ganglion cells, neurons whose axons constitute the output from this structure to the brain via the second cranial nerves.

It acts by binding to one of two receptor sites normally used by the substance whose effects it is designed to counteract, but can cause sleepiness in the process.	FTP, what are these synthetic drugs used to combat inflammation and allergies"
8442,"The term for these regions was coined in 1936 by horticulturalist Cyril Dean Darlington, and research shows a surprising lack of conservation between organisms.	Adjectives such as metacentric and acrocentric have been coined to identify its location.	In karyotypes it appears as a narrow area, but its properties are diffused along the length of the chromosome.	FTP, name this cytogenetic region where spindle fibers attach during cell division and which is named for its usually central location."
8451,"One of the diagrams it can generate is known as the Eadie-Hofstee, which magnifies departure from linearity that may not be apparent in the better-known diagram that it generates.	It simply assumes that the rate of the formation of the product, P, is proportional to the concentration of the complex.	A curve can be generated from it using the Lineweaver-Burke plot and ""V sub M"" or maximum velocity occurs at the point where the curve flattens out.	It states that velocity is greatest when all active sites are filled with substrate.

Having a special sensory function, FTP, name this first cranial nerve, the one associated with smell."
8469,"W. D. Hamilton and John Jaenike were among the earliest proponents of this idea.	Its first part states that, in tightly coevolved interactions, evolutionary changes by one species could lead to extinction for another species, and that the probability of such an event is independent of the species' age.

Some of them, such as Pyrodictium are highly thermophilic, while others, such as Sulfolobus, are dependent upon sulfur for their metabolism.	The most common varieties employed in research are the Halo- and Methanobacterium.	Discovered by Carl Weiss, FTP, identify this group of bacteria that, despite their cytological similarity to prokaryotes, are hypothesized to be the evolutionary precursor to eukaryotes."
8514,"Although its panacinar form can be caused by a genetic deficiency of the enzyme alpha-1-anti-trypsin, its more common centrilobular form usually results from a far more nefarious activity.	This disease leads to chronic dilation and destruction of air spaces without fibrosis, leading to a great increase in compliance of the lung and shortness of breath.	FTP, name this chronic obstructive lung disease common to smokers."
8523,"In one relationship, they envelop the gonidia or allow reproduction via the soredia.	The first structures to emerge from the propagule, they are composed of chitin, and secrete the enzyme laccase.	They lack plastids, though their central vacuoles are surrounded by a multinucleate cytoplasm that provides mass for their statolithic function.

8568,"When the word ""genomic"" is placed in front of this term, the phrase denotes an epigenetic modification where activation of a gene depends on the parent from which it was received.	Johnson and Bolhuis identified two mechanisms for two independent neural systems that may control its filial variety, and it serves as an explanation of monogamy in some animals.	The critical time period for it in humans is around eight months of age, and it was co-discovered by Oscar Heinroth and first observed in the greylag goose.

8577,"The N(6)-methylation [enn six meth-uh-LAY-shun] of this chemical is mediated by dam methylase in many bacteria.	Deamination of this compound's C(6) amino group by double-bonded oxygen yields the hypoxanthine found in tRNA inosine.	Its N(7) and N(6) positions form additional hydrogen bonds in Hoogsteen pairing, and it absorbs at 260 nm [""nanometers""] more strongly than any other nitrogenous base.	In its most common role, its nitrogen-9 is syn- or anti-linked in a N-beta-glycosyl bond to the carbon-1' [""one prime""] of a pentose by condensation of water.	Containing a NH2 at C(6) of a double ring, FTP, name this purine that has bonds with thymine and uracil in DNA and RNA, respectively."
8586,"This messenger's system is antagonistic to that of dopamine, so malfunction of it is linked with epilepsy, while destruction of this chemical's producers in the striatum results in Huntington's disease.	In insects, this neurotransmitter mediates muscle activation nerve-muscle synapses, while its brain levels in humans are controlled by glutamate decarboxylase.

FTP name these gram-negative bacteria that form symbiotic relationships with legumes, producing nitrogen-fixing root nodules."
8649,"These organisms may have evolved from Spriggina and Parvancorina, while those of the order Lichida may have had horns.	Their earliest order is Redlichiida, which did not have the natant hypostome of the ensuing Ptychopariida and Harpetida types, and the Proetida were the longest-lasting.

8658,"The first enzyme in this process uses a biotin prosthetic group to form an activated intermediate, which can only be transported by being converted to one of two products, including the result of an aminotransferase, aspartate.	That intermediate then loses its newly acquired carboxyl group in a reaction that also produces a GDP.

Also used to produce alcohols from carbonyls, FTP, identify these organometallic compounds produced from a haloalkane and magnesium."
9153,"When reacted with hydroxylamine it forms an oxime and when reduced by a sodium amalgam it is converted into isopropyl alcohol.

FTP, name this organic compound, the active ingredient in nail-polish remover and the simplest of the ketones."
9162,"It is most commonly illustrated through reactions with halogenoalkanes, where a reactive species attacks the carbon atom in the carbon-halogen bond.	Though it would appear that the extreme polarization of the carbon-fluorine bond would make this mechanism especially reactive with fluorocarbons, the strength of the bond decreases the effectiveness of the mechanism.	FTP, what is this reaction mechanism, in which a reactant with lone electrons attacks a region with positive charge"
9171,"The probability with which an atom may emit a fluorescent line photon, rather than exhibit this effect, is the fluorescent yield.	Spectroscopy which utilizes this effect bombards a material with photons with energies between 2 and 50 kilo-electron-volts, which allows for component analysis of thin surfaces as electrons can only a short distance.	FTP, name this effect also known as autoionization, in which light causes the ejection of a K-shell electron, named for a French physicist."
9180,"The primary use of this principle is in making band assignments and deducing the relative shapes of two different electronic states.	It allows the prediction of vertical transitions from classical turning points, and assumes that nuclear locations do not change until after their electrons have adopted their final distributions.	An extension of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, FTP, name this principle which states that in fast reactions such as transitions of electron states, there is no time for geometry to change."
9189,"For a colloid, this point is where the zeta potential of colloidal particles is zero, and is dependent on particle surface properties.

His 1857 paper on the kinetic theory introduced the concept of mean free path.

107460,"The addition of potassium hydroxide as a promoter increases the efficiency of this process, and one of its ingredients was originally isolated by the water-gas process invented by the man whose name is sometimes appended to this process.	Although an initial pass typically has a small yield, its inventor also came up with the idea of recycling the output of this process, which consumes roughly 1% of the world's annual energy output.

Cases in which this type of isomer can occur are limited by the fact that pi bonds disallow longitudunal twists in general, so it requires the presence of formal sigma bonds.

For 10 points, name this category of stereoisomers that are interconverted between by rotations about single bonds."

Calculating that sum results in a proportionality factor known as the Madelung constant, meaning that in ionic crystals with regular structure this quantity depends only on geometry.

103986,"In his memoirs, this man says he once lost the respect of an Italian cabinet minister by saying he didnt embezzle funds.	Marxist thinker Guy Debord credited this man with inventing modern functionalism, but criticized this mans field as an inherently capitalist science, while Robert Herbert claimed to see the effects of this mans work reflected in Manets Bar at the Folies-Bergere.	After Emile Ollivier forced this man to resign his most famous office, he represented Corsica in Parliament, despite originally being from Alsace.

Blackbird Creek Co., which concerned a dam in Deleware.	The majority opinion cites Welton v. Missouri and the Louisiana civil rights case Hall v. De Cuir to define an important term.	That majority opinion was written by Samuel Miller, while the Joseph Bradley dissent was joined by Chief Justice Morrison Waite.

Illinois and led to the Interstate Commerce Act.	For ten points, name this 1886 Supreme Court case holding that states could not regulate railroad rates."
104013,"The Armenian merchant Khojah Nicholas negotiated a political agreement after this battle.	The winners of this battle had refused to pay taxes to the losers, citing their dastak permits, and had shielded supporters of Ghaseti Behgum, an enemy of the losing commander.	The victors, who were being paid by the corrupt banker Jagat Sheth, were forced to fight the Battles of Chinsura and Buxar in the aftermath of this battle.	Mir Madan led a bold attack early in this battle, but fell to artillery fire, scattering his troops.

104040,"Prior to this battle, the losing commander ignored the advice of his advisor Cassius Longinus and made a river crossing at Zeugma.	An important moment in this battle was the arrival of a camel caravan carrying arrows, which allowed the victors, led by Surena, to maintain their namesake strategy of feigning retreat on horseback only to turn around and fire arrows.

Captain Thomas Grantham used sea power to help end this conflict, and results of it include the hanging of Colonel Hansford and the coming to power of Lord Culpepper.	Resulting in the calling of the Long Assembly, this conflict was sparked when Thomas Matthews farm was attacked by the Doeg Indians, but the settlers retaliated against the Susquehannocks instead, sparking a general Indian war that required raising a militia under a man from Curls Wharf who became upset that the governor refused to help.

In the papal bulls Sublimus Dei and Sicut Dudum, Popes Eugene IV and Paul III advocated this action.	In Revolutionary France, the Girondist Jacques Pierre Brissot was the chief proponent of this action, which was reversed by Napoleon in 1802, and the Mussolini government did this in Ethiopia after occupying it.

That man, Prince Charles, was the son of Duke Leopold Joseph the Good, who regained control of this place under the Treaty of Ryswick.	Under Duke Charles V, it merged with the Duchy of Bar.	At the end of the War of the Polish Succession, the losing claimant to the Polish throne became Duke of this place, and it later merged with the Bishoprics of Toul, Metz, and Verdun.

One holder of this office repealed the Lex Aelia Fufia, while Publius Sulpicius Rufus held this post during the Social War.	In fact, it was largely because of Sulpicius that Sulla later temporarily caused anyone elected to it to be ineligible for future offices and briefly overturned the Lex Hortensia by stripping this post of lawmaking power.	One holder of this office attempted to remove his colleague Marcus Octavius for accepting massive bribes and one was killed by Philocrates, after which his skull was split and filled with molten lead.

It led to the Seiyukai Cabinet of Inukai Tsuyoshi replacing the more moderate cabinet of Wakatsuki Reijiro, and in response to this event, Chang Hseh-liang was ordered to pursue an unpopular policy of nonresistance.	Originally planned by Seishiro Itagaki and Kanji Ishiwara, this event occurred on September 18th when Suemori Komoto placed explosives at Liutiaokuo, and caused the United States to issue the Stimson Doctrine.

Its real part gives the Fresnel reflection coefficients, and it relates the displacement field to the electric field.	Also called the relative permeability, for ten points, identify this constant whose namesake materials are often inserted between the plates of capacitors."
10422,"In deriving this, it is crucial to assume that the amplitude function varies slowly, so its spatial derivatives vanish.	Used in the Gamow theory of alpha decay, this method assumes a form of Aei [""A times e to the i phi""] for the wave function, and results in the quantization condition, which comes from integrating the classical momentum over the potential well, that the well endpoint phase difference divided by pi is equal to one minus one-half times the number of ""soft"" boundaries.	FTP, name this method that is used to find approximate bound state wave functions and named for the initials of three or four European physicists."
10431,"The ratio of this name is the ratio of the high and low voltage points in a transmission line system, which can be used to find impedance via a bolometer, and a like-named ratio of maximum to minimum dilatation is used in acoustics.	Classical cavity electromagnetic modes are of this form, but the use of that fact to predict a blackbody spectrum results in the erroneous Rayleigh-Jeans law.	Schrdinger modified the Bohr model of the atom by treating electrons as these, which may be considered as a superposition of oppositely directed waves of equal amplitude, frequency, and wavelength.	FTP, identify these types of waves so named because they appear to be stationary."
10440,"This law applies whenever the reciprocal lattice points of a grid touch the surface of Ewald's sphere, since the radius of the sphere is the frequency.	It may be used to model its namesake type of Brillouin scattering, which applies to acoustic vibrations that provide the surfaces upon which it depends.	It reduces to its simplest form when the path length difference for two initially parallel wave vectors is an integer multiple of the incident wavelength.	FTP, name this equation that predicts the interference extrema for photon scattering from a periodic lattice, and that may be stated ""n lambda equals 2d sine theta""."
10449,"Recent evidence for a strongly coupled version of it includes anomalous J/psi suppression in lead-lead collisions at CERN and jet-quenching and monojet production in collisions between gold atoms and bulk collective elliptical flow at Brookhaven National Laboratory's heavy ion collider.	The standard model predicts its existence through lattice calculations showing a rapid rise in entropy at around 160 mega-electron volts, after which the number of degrees of freedom saturate.	Predicted to exist in the cores of dense neutron stars as well as during the first 1 to 10 microseconds of the universe's existence, FTP identify this state of matter in which hadrons decompose into their constituent components, which is abbreviated QGP."
10458,"His major work was criticized by Joseph Petzval on flimsy mathematical grounds.	His assumptions were also criticized by a Dutch metereologist who created the first experiment to provide verification of this man's work.	One of the conclusions drawn by this man seemed to be supported by an astronomical Catalogue published by Benedict Sestini, but it wasn't until William Huggins introduced more advanced spectroscopic methods that research could proceed.	He was under the impression that all stars were white and only emitted light in the visible spectrum, which led him to draw dubious conclusions about double stars.	One version of this man's best-known observation was famously taken up by Fizeau, while he didn't believe that his principle could be applied to transverse vibrations of light.	FTP, name this Austrian scientist who in an 1842 paper showed that the observed frequency of light and sound waves changes with the relative motion of the source or observer of those waves, an ""effect"" named for him."
10467,"Maxwell's equations may be derived by extremizing the time integral of the one of these corresponding to a charge in an electromagnetic field.	Its form for a mechanical system is motivated by requiring the virtual displacements in d'Alembert's principle to vanish.	Generalized momenta are velocity partials of this function.	If it is cyclic in a coordinate, that coordinate's generalized momentum is constant due to the equation of Euler and this function's namesake.	FTP, identify this function central to a non-Newtonian formulation of physics and conventionally equal to the difference of kinetic and potential energies."
10476,"They are admitted as topological defects, a special case of dyons, and are generally supermassive.	One-dimensional analogues of cosmic strings, they were posited by Dirac to explain conservation of angular momentum and charge.	Most grand unified theories predict their existence at a density such that a small loop of superconducting wire should be able to detect one per year, but none have been detected yet, even in searches of lunar rocks.	They are classically forbidden, since the field they ostensibly generate must be divergence-free by Gauss' law for it.	FTP, name these hypothetical charges; theoretical sources for the magnetic field."
10485,"Gliner and Zeldovich are credited with the modern interpretation, in which it contributes its value times the metric tensor divided by 8 pi times the gravitational constant to the energy-momentum tensor.	In the Friedmann equation, it appears on the right-hand side divided by three, and measurements from WMAP have suggested that its energy density is approximately 0.7 times the critical density.	Its equation of state parameter w is -1, giving a negative effective pressure that tends to accelerate the expansion of the Universe.	FTP name this simple form of dark energy, rejected by Einstein as his ""greatest mistake.	"""
10494,"The occurrence of this effect in atmospheric molecular oxygen is the dominant cause of polarized atmospheric emissions around 60 GHz.	The Lyman-alpha transition is a manifestation of this effect, and the energies associated with one form of it can be written as being proportional to the Lande g-factor.	This effect obeys selection rules which permit a change in orbital quantum number by plus or minus one, and a change in the magnetic quantum number by either zero or plus or minus one.	Its strong-field form is known as the Paschen-Back effect, and its weak-field, or anomalous form was the first to be discovered by its namesake.	FTP, identify this effect in which degenerate energy levels of an atom are split by a magnetic field."
10503,"In the nonlinear hyper version of this effect, otherwise forbidden silent modes are seen, and in another variant, its strength is increased by the excitation of plasmons in small metal particles.	The stimulated form of it can be used in silicon chips or fiber optics to create an eponymous kind of laser, and in biological applications of it, a 785 nanometer source is often used to minimize the competing effect of fluorescence.	Three lasers are used to gather information about the vibrational modes of chemical bonds susceptible to changes in polarizability in the coherent anti-Stokes variety of it.	For 10 points, identify this type of inelastic scattering named for its Indian discoverer."
10512,"Erwin Finlay-Freundlich proposed one explanation for this phenomenon that claimed its strength should be proportional to the radiation density.	A version of this phenomenon in the CMB is known as the Sachs-Wolfe effect, while the quantity that describes the strength of this effect has a value of about 1100 for the surface of last scattering.	One version of this effect was measured using the Mossbauer effect in an experiment by Pound and Rebka, and the magnitude of this effect is usually denoted ""z.	"" For 10 points, name this phenomenon, which can be caused by gravity or the Doppler effect, in which the wavelength of an object's light appears longer to an observer."
10521,"In the surface enhanced variety of this effect, the magnitude can be increased by the presence of small metal particles near a substance to be studied, probably due to plasmon resonance.	Creating ultraviolet resonance is another technique to improve the magnitude of this effect, which is typically much weaker than the competing processes of diffuse reflectance and fluorescence.	It results when an electron enters a virtual excited state, then relaxes via the emission of a photon to either a higher or lower vibrational energy level, creating the Stokes or anti-Stokes variety, respectively.	FTP name this type of inelastic scattering first observed by its Indian namesake."
10530,"In a material with this property, the remanence refers to its magnitude in the absence of a driving force, while coercivity measures how strong a field is needed to remove this property.	Its lack of retraceability is noted by a hysteresis loop, and this phenomenon can be attributed to the unfilled energy levels in the 3d level of certain elements.	The susceptibility of materials possessing this property can be determined by the Curie-Weiss law beyond a specific point.	It is a result of permanent unpaired dipoles within domains that line up with an imposed magnetic field due to long range ordering.	Once materials exhibiting this property surpass the Curie temperature, they tend to behave as paramagnets.	FTP, name this form of magnetism common to particular metals, most notably observed in nickel, cobalt, and iron."
10539,"The Hay test for jaundice makes use of this property because bile can alter its value for urine.	Thermodynamically, it is defined as the partial derivative of Gibbs free energy with respect to area at constant pressure and temperature, and it is related to temperature via the Eotvos equation.	LaPlace's law relates the collapsing pressure of a spherical bubble to twice the value of this property, which is also the driving force of capillary action.	Measured in dynes per centimeter and explained by the cohesive forces between molecules with nothing above them, FTP name this quantity that can be lowered by surfactants and allows certain bugs to walk on water."
10548,"Its trace is the divergence of the dilatation current, and thus zero in a conformal theory.	In Yang-Mills theory it corresponds to an interpolating operator for spin 2 glueballs.	For an ideal fluid, knowing it is equivalent to knowing the pressure and density, and it is diagonal in a comoving frame.	The Noether procedure finds it as a set of conserved currents associated to translation invariance, but this may not produce a symmetric answer.	The usual symmetric definition is a variation of the nongravitational part of the action with respect to the metric.	FTP, what is this quantity that the Einstein equations relate to the curvature of space"
10557,"A recent experiment that attempted to replicate its namesake's original set-up was done by Gianni Carugno and Roberto Onofrio, but its value only agreed to within 15% of the expected theoretical value, in part because of the technical difficulties involved in calculating it.	Predicted while its namesake was working with colloidal solutions, it shows that the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius in the chiral bag model of the nucleon.	It was measured in 1996 by Steven Lamoreaux, and its formula is pi-squared times c times h-bar times area, divided by 240 times distance to the fourth power.	FTP, name this consequence of QED, a type of van der Waals force between two parallel plates in a vacuum, which is named for a Dutch scientist and which is not as related to zero-point energy as many like to think."
10566,"The operator problem of this name can be solved by the so-called ""algebraic method"" using the raising and lowering operators and was solved by Dirac to model photons.	The utility of this model arises because of the nature of the first-order expansion of a potential energy about an equilibrium.	The equation by this name arises from a quadratic-potential Lagrangian or from combining Newton's second law and Hooke's law.	This is therefore a good model for a perturbed atom, AC circuit, first-order pendulum, or mass on a spring.	FTP, name these physical systems that, if unforced, have sinusoidal motion."
10575,"The equilibrium state for these devices is found by balancing the coronal discharge loss flux and triboelectric current.	Pelletrons are essentially a refined versions of these devices, two of which operated in tandem can produce a potential difference of about 25 megavolts.	Leakage of stored charge is sometimes prevented by insulating them with sulfur hexafluoride.	Simple versions involve a belt of insulating material running over two pulleys and transferring charge to a metal spherical shell.	FTP, identify this type of electrostatic machine, often used to generate electrical sparks."
10584,"In a color glass condensate, this phenomenon would prevent the rapid movement of gluons.	This phenomenon was first predicted for electrons by Joseph Larmor, and the Voigt transformation was the first general expression involving this value, though that value was too large.	The red shift experiments of Pound and Rebka demonstrated the existence of its  (*) gravitational variety.	It has been confirmed in the Hafele-Keating experiment, where cesium decay was measured in a moving high-speed jet, and in Rossi and Hall's measurements of the decay of muons ejected from the sun's atmosphere.	FTP, name this phenomenon that creates a relative slowing of time as one approaches the speed of light."
10593,"In three dimensions, one type of this phenomenon can be derived from applying two Lorentz transformations whose velocities point in opposite directions.	In general, that phenomenon accounts for the difference between a naive estimate and the true spin-orbit Hamiltonian.	Another type is utilized by NMR.	In classical mechanics, its period is defined as 4 pi-squared times an object's moment of inertia, all divided by its torque times the period about a certain axis, while planetary orbits may undergo apsidal or perihelion types.	Geometric, Thomas, and gyroscopic are also different types of, FTP, what phenomenon, the change in direction of an object's axis of gyration"
10602,"The Lax-Wendroff and Leapfrog schemes modify the general equation for this process.	For a cylinder in cross flow, the Churchill-Bernstein equation estimates the Nusselt number for this process.	One type of this process is named for Boussinesq, and Benard cells take on a hexagonal shape when undergoing this process.	The Richardson number determines whether it is free or forced, and when the Rayleigh number is above the critical value for a fluid, heat transfer occurs through this process.	FTP, identify this process, the flow of heat through the movement of matter from a hot region to a cold region, which is opposite from conduction."
10611,"Using Ramanujan's identity or a combination of the Euler identity and Jacobi triple product, p congruencies for it can be found, and Liebniz noted that it was not prime for n equals 7.	Numbers which can not be written as a product of it correspond to nonisomorphic Abelian groups that are not possible for any group order.	As a function of the volume, temperature, and number of particles in a system, it connects the mechanical properties of a system, through the quantized energies, with the system's thermodynamic properties and its inverse serves as the constant of proportionality between the probability of finding the system in a certain quantum state and the Boltzmann factor.	FTP, what is this quantity, represented as Q or Z, which is the sum of all the energy states of a system and gives the distributed of energy over all the possible microstates of the system"
10620,"The edge named for this phenomenon describes the feature of a spectograph caused by it, and its namesake suppression counteracts that edge.	Dense galactic clusters perturb the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation through an inverse form of this, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.	Plank's constant divided by a particle's rest mass times the speed of light gives its namesake wavelength, and the derivative of its cross-section is given by the Klein-Nishina formula.	For 10 points, name this effect which describes a decrease in the wavelength of a photon when it collides with an electron, an American physicist's namesake scattering."
10629,"This statement contributes to the repulsive one over r to the twelfth term in the Lennard-Jones Potential.	Its rigorous statement requires that particles with half-integer spin have anti-symmetrical wave functions, and it also explains neutron degeneracy, which prevents smaller neutron stars from collapsing into black holes.	The ""+1"" term seen in the denominator of the Fermi-Dirac distribution arises due to this statement, and bosons do not have to obey it, but fermions such as protons and electrons do.	For 10 points, name this law of quantum mechanics, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state at the same time."
10638,"One example of this phenomenon is chiral autocatalysis from apparently racemic solutions, while in another context, this term applies to asynchronous protein cascades involved in coagulation.	This concept was defined by Krasnoselski using the theory nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear operators, and the energy lost through this phenomenon is given by the Steinmetz equation.	A model of this phenomenon based on monocrystals was devised by Weiss, while a model of it whose building blocks are relay nonlinearities is named after Preisach.	A form of this phenomenon results in an example of self-organized criticality known as the Barkhausen effect, and the characteristic loop produced by this phenomenon appears on the graph of magnetization versus magnetic field strength.	For ten points, identify this phenomenon in which a material exhibits a ""memory,"" or a time-lagging dependence on applied stress.  "
10647,"One set of polynomials used to describe these phenomena are the basis for the ENZ theory and are orthogonal on the unit disk.	In addition to the Zernike polynomials, one of these phenomena is called the Petzval curvature.	The sine theorem can be used to characterize another one of these in which point sources appear to have a long tail.	Seidel decomposed them into five different types, and the Schmidt plate is used to correct one that occurs due to varying focal length across a spherical lens.	Also coming in a chromatic variety, FTP, name these effects which include tilt, astigmatism, and distortion, which leads to blurring of images in imperfect lenses."
10656,"Paul Wesson's variant of this theory shows that the soliton solutions of the equation R sub a b equals zero contains the Robertson-Walker metric; that version called the space-time-matter theory.	Randall and Sundrum developed a variant of it that relies on a bulk that contains two branes separated by sixteen units.	Separating out its equations gives rise to a scalar field called the radion.	It posits a topology of R4 cross S1, and used a first-order Fourier expansion to characterize a periodic, compact extra dimension.	FTP, name this five-dimensional gravitational theory that attempted to unify electromagnetism and general relativity, named for its two formulators."
10665,"Wright et al.	determined that Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage could be used to transfer orbital angular momentum to this type of substance.	Ignat and Millot verified the appropriateness of the Thomas-Fermi approximation of solutions to an equation that describes the behavior of these substances.	Optical lattices are used to study certain varieties of these entities, including Tonks-Girardeau gases.	Described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, one of these composed of diatomic lithium was created in 2006, and the creation of the first one won Wiemann and Cornell the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.	Predicted in 1924 by one of its namesakes, for 10 points, name this type of substance, first created by supercooling rubidium-87 atoms, the so-called ""fifth state of matter"". "
10674,"Hans Hendrik Andersen demonstrated that the stopping power of these objects does not follow the Bethe formula, a result that proved the existence of the Barkas effect, and they are the cause of both pleochroic halos and of mineral metamictization.	The last step in the CNO cycle creates a carbon atom and one of these.	These are only associated with elements heavier than tellurium.	Timothy May discovered that emission of these from DRAM can cause soft errors in microprocessor operations, and the Geiger-Nuttall law relates the life of an isotope to the production of these.	For 10 points, identify these particles that escape from radioactive elements via quantum tunneling and Coulomb repulsion, which were used in Rutherford's gold foil experiment and are identical to a helium-4 nucleus."
10683,"If sufficiently light, these particles could be produced in a Drell-Yan type process which would occur in proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron.	The first solution to the Yang-Mills equation was one of these particles named for Wu and Yang, and Dirac showed that these particles imply quantization of electric charge.	Providing symmetry to Maxwells equations, these particles contradict the fact that the divergence of the B-field is zero, thereby violating Gausss law for magnetism.	For 10 points, identify these particles, the magnetic analogues of charge with either north or south-oriented directions."
10692,"Spin foam serves as a model for 4-geometries used to dynamically observe the quantum form of this force.	Mossbauer spectroscopy of an iron-57 gamma emitter was used to measure Doppler redshift associated with this force in the Pound-Rebka experiment, and two lead balls were used to construct a torsion balance to measure the magnitude of this force in the Cavendish experiment.	Conceptualized by wells in spacetime, for 10 points, identify this weakest fundamental force that causes objects in the air to accelerate to Earth at 9.8 meters per second squared."
10701,"The transition temperature of these systems is proportional to the particle density divided by the Riemann zeta function, all to the two-thirds power.	Vortices in them are allowed via the psi-squared term in the equation describing the wavefunction of these systems.	Sweeping a magnetic field through one of these causes spin-flip collisions and the Feschbach resonance, while further increasing the field causes an implosion followed by an explosion in a namesake type of nova.	Their wavefunction is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.	They were first created by Cornell, Wieman, and Ketterle by laser-cooling a bunch of rubidium atoms.

10710,"The equation governing these systems sets the minor-radius laplacian of psi equal to the sum of terms containing the derivative of pressure in terms of psi minus a term containing the poloidal current times its derivative; that equation is the Grad-Shafranov equation.	One effect in these objects is a shift of the center of density away from the geometric center, a shift likewise named for Shafranov.	Confinement in these devices occurs due to a driven torodial plasma current; these devices are thus similar to stellerators, which have additional helical coils.	The largest of them currently in operation is JET, which will be replaced by ITER when the latter is complete.	For 10 points, name these toroidal magnetic confinement devices for hot plasmas which are candidates as nuclear fusion reactors."

Techniques based on this effect include a spatially-offset method, and another method involves adsorbing molecules to a rough metal and is enhanced by incident radiation hitting plasmons.	Only molecules which undergo a change in polarization via this effect are visible in its namesake form of spectroscopy, which often employs a continuous-wave laser.	Emission occurs when the molecule either has a net gain or loss in energy, giving the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines.	For 10 points, name this inelastic scattering of light by a molecule, named for an Indian physicist."
10728,"In tokamaks in which a separatrix exists, the safety factor obtains this value at the separatrix.	By analyzing the two-dimensional Ising model, Kramers and Wannier established that the specific heat took on this value at the Curie point.	This value is obtained when computing the occupancy number for the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate, and classical calculations of electron self-energies also yield this value.	In quantum field theory, terms having this value are removed through the process of renormalization, and this value is also obtained for the energy radiated by a black body when extrapolating the Rayleigh-Jeans law to higher frequencies.	For 10 points, identify this value attained by the classical metric of general relativity at the singularity of a black hole, in which things get unquantifiably large."
109125,"The gap between them has recently been proposed to be caused by very low frequency waves from lightning strikes in the atmosphere.	Sometimes viewed as a solar-driven current, one is thought to result from electrons stuck in the earths geomagnetic field, while the one closer to Earth has as it source the decay of neutrons from cosmic ray collisions.

117378,"The Churchill-Bernstein equation is a simplification of this to estimate the Nusselt number for a cylinder.	Jean Leray proved the existence of a weak solution, and in the continuous limit, the Lattice Boltzmann equation is a (*) solution.	The convective acceleration term confers a nonlinear effect, contributing to the difficulty in determining a full solution to this Millenium Problem.	Taking the curl eliminates the pressure term from these equations, and further simplification arises when considering only isochoric or Newtonian fluids.

For ten points, name these subatomic particles coming in electron, tau, and muon flavors, and thought to not have mass until recently."
109350,"Induction coils with spark gaps were the first devices to suggest its existence.	When the receiving coil in an 1887 experiment was enclosed in a dark case, the observed spark was always smaller.	The aforementioned work by Hertz was followed by contributions in the area from Thomson and Lenard.	Lenard found that it was independent of the ultraviolet lights intensity, but it took until the article On a Heuristic Point of View about the Creation and Conversion of Light for the concept to be widely diffused.

For an ideal elastic material, the resilience is equal to the square of this property divided by twice the elastic modulus.	The value of this property may be practically determined by the two-thousandths offset method, given a real strain test curve; it is ideally the stress at the proportional limit, (*) at which plastic deformation begins.

117576,"Leon Guoy found that this phenomenon was unaffected by electromagnetism or light and occurred to a greater extent in less viscous fluids.	Lars Onsager used it to extend the Debye Huckel theory for ionic solutions.	Combining the Stokes formula in consideration equipartition of a sphere allowed (*) Langevin to develop an equation explaining this.	The Monte Carlo method can simulate this Wiener process since it is stochastic, and Jean Perrin observed molecules in large jars to estimate Avogadro's number from this process.

The author writes that the work is grounded in listening, and the discussion of the Heinz dilemma centers around Julia's need to resolve a network of relationships rather than considering individual rights.

That language differentiates between eight types of this construct, as does Swahili, which marks this construct by prefixing every word in the clause related to the noun which carries it, even the verb.

The risk-neutral measure of it can be given by the Carmeron-Martin-Girsanov theorem, and its most well-known variants are the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein method and the Garman-Kohlhagen measure, which extends it to foreign values.	The market's expectation creates the volatility smile problem in this method, which assumes geometrical Brownian motion and an absence of arbitrage and delta-hedging.

117738,"This practice is limited by the concept of nisab, and like the similar practice of Khums this practice was once overseen by the Bayt al-mal.	A special form of this practice performed only once a year is named for Eid al-Fitr and takes place after fasting.	This practice's name translates as ""to grow"", and it is contrasted with the similar Sadaqa, which is voluntary.	The dead, descendents of the Prophet Muhammad, and non-Muslims are not allowed to benefit from this practice, nor is it required if one's harvest is modest.	For ten points, name this Pillar of Islam that involves giving to the poor."
117747,"In Japanese tradition, a dragon of this color guards the eastern signs of the zodiac, while in Christian art Cherubim are traditionally dressed in robes of this color, in contrast to the red robes of Seraphim.	Among the Ancient Hebrews, this color was made from the hilazon snail.

117756,"This work cites St. Jerome's interpretation of the four creatures in a cloud envisioned by Ezekiel to analyze the functional characteristics of men and eventually distinguish between synderesis and conscience.	In its second section, this work posits that fallen angels are still subject to God's designs because God fated them to fall from grace in order to test the faith of humans.	This work's final section expands St. Augustine's definition of the sacraments to characterize them as causing the grace they signify.	Thomas Aquinas appended a commentary on this work as the last part of the Summa Theologica, and this work arranges biblical texts in conjunction with quotations of Church Fathers and contemporary theologians in a comprehensive overview of medieval theology.

117765,"One recurring theme in this man's stories is exemplified by a cicada and a wren who dismiss tales of birds flying hundreds of miles as impossible because they can barely reach a nearby tree.	In one story, this man compared himself to a ""holy tortoise"" who would rather ""drag its tail in the mud"" than be dead and have its bones venerated, thus rejecting a position in the Kingdom of Wei.	He claimed to know for a fact that darting around gives minnows pleasure while crossing a bridge with Huishi, and a god of rivers realizes that the ocean is infinite in the famous ""Autumn floods"" section of the work named for this man.	Tales of a hunchback who catches cicadas and a bellstand carver who fasts are amongst the illustrations of this man's concept of ""flowing cognition"" or ""yan-shi.	"" For 10 points, name this Chinese philosopher best known for his ""butterfly dream.	"""
117774,"In this work, the author twice criticizes the article on Rorarius in his rival's Dictionary for disputing his ideas, and the term appetition is used to label an internal principle causing perceptions to change.	The example of dogs fleeing when threatened with sticks is used to illustrate the definition of the soul as possessing both perception and memory, and the author criticizes the lack of a distinction between prolonged unconsciousness and absolute death in Cartesian philosophy.	The existence of God is proven a priori as a necessary truth dependent on contradiction and a posteriori as a contingent truth dependent on sufficient reason.

Expounding the theory that all compound substances are composed of the namesake simple ones, FTP, name this treatise by Gottfried Leibniz."
117783,"Massimo dell'Utri's article ""Choosing Conceptions of Realism"" is an analysis of this concept.	This concept's formulation posits a man who ""has been told he understands Japanese"", as well as a picture of a tree accidentally dropped by a spaceship.	This concept is introduced in a chapter which begins by considering an ant tracing curves in sand such that it produces a recognizable caricature of Winston Churchill, leading into a discussion of magical theories of reference.	This thought experiment compares its namesake entities with Turing machines playing the imitation game and is refuted on the basis of semantic externalism.

That figure, who was described as ""a monster of wickedness beyond of all others"" killed his brother-in-law, Sychaeus, forcing Anna and her sister to flee Tyre.	The more famous figure of this name was the grandfather of Adonis through his daughter, Metharme.

For ten points, give this shared name of the evil brother of Dido and the lover of Galatea."
117819,"This work uses the analogy of an ostrich burying its head in the sand is used to explain the reasoning behind one idea.	This work praises one concept for enabling the building of great structures of stone and shows another concept's shortcomings by comparing Plato's and Kepler's models of planetary motion.	A formula whose truth depends on the validity of inferences determined by it is termed a ""guiding principle of inference"", and the idea of a quality is presented as a metaphysical conception which disrupts logical reasoning.	The author states that the sole end of inquiry is the settlement of opinion, which is approached via the ""method of tenacity"", ""method of authority"", ""a priori method"", and ""method of science"".	Contrasting the title concept with doubt, FTP, name this essay by Charles Sanders Peirce."
117828,"The concept of Hit Bononut was developed by a sub-group of this movement.	Important texts in this movement include the Sefat Emet, the Shabbos of Gershom Scholem, and the Tanya.

117882,"A commentary on this text begins by telling a story in which a god creates independent body parts that demand a body to live on and reject the body of a cow and a horse before agreeing to be placed on a human.	The Khilani is sometimes added to this text, but is younger and considered apocryphal.	This text is more frequently followed by the Aitareya.

One type is generated in impact cratering events, and often includes shocked quartz in its composition.	Diatremes are volcanic pipes which have filled with this rock which is often formed during violent hydrothermal events.

In order to theoretically clarify the benefit of Indirect Rule, this anthropologist along with Meyer Fortes, co-authored a study of the political systems of 6 societies including the Bemba and Logoli.

The absence of Campanian black glazed wares and the findings in the so-called ""Chariot Room,"" represent evidence for Augustan date for the earliest levels of the main site.	In approximately 119 AD, historical documents report that Quintus Servilius Candidus brought water for the Hadrian Baths complex located in this city.	The remains of mud-brick structures support the notion that this city was founded by Phoenicians in 10th century BC, and this city was abandoned after it was sacked by a Berber tribe in 523 AD.

The lines, ""and even if thou wert the greatest of sinners, with the help of the bark of wisdom thou shalt cross the sea of evil,"" which appear in the Bhagavad Gita, makes a case for jnana-marga, a doctrine associated with this concept.
